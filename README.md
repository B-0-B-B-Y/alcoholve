# alcoholve
A quiz-based multiplayer game, where you compete against your friends. The twist - you set an alcoholic beverage of choice as punishment for losing. If you finish the game below a certain point threshold, you have to do a shot / take a big swig of the ante. With each round, the point threshold gets higher and higher. Game ends when everyone fails to reach the point threshold.
